# Python Stuff

contains a .py that I use to fix the csv created by my other programs (quite often "," is used between thousands and millions and it messes up with the data so I have to use ";" instead of "," as a delimiter.

This program selects all .csv files in the folder, removes "," and replaces ";" by ",".
